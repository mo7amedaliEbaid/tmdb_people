# TMDB Flutter Assessment â€” Full Project (Hive + UseCases + Bloc)

This document contains a complete, ready-to-copy Flutter project scaffold that implements the assessment using:
- `flutter_bloc` (state management)
- `go_router` (navigation)
- `flutter_screenutil` (responsiveness)
- `hive` + `hive_flutter` (offline caching & models)
- `intl` + `flutter_localizations` (localization scaffold)

It includes a generic API client, error handling, repository pattern, domain use-cases, a Cubit for popular people with infinite scroll, screens, widgets, and an image viewer with saving support.

---

## Important notes before using
1. Replace `YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY` in `lib/configs/api_config.dart`.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` to generate Hive adapters (`person_model.g.dart`).
4. Register the generated adapter in `main.dart` and open the Hive box.
